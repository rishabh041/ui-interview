Autocomplete 
Develop a React Autocomplete component that provides suggestions to users as they type into an input field. The component should have the following features:
Asynchronous Data Fetching: Fetch suggestions asynchronously from a remote server or API as the user types.
Debounce: Implement debouncing functionality to optimize the data fetching process.
List Rendering: Display the fetched suggestions in a dropdown list below the input field.
Requirements:
User Interface (UI):
Create a React component called Autocomplete that consists of an input field.
Below the input field, render a dropdown list to display the fetched suggestions.
Ensure the dropdown list dynamically adjusts its size based on the number of suggestions and available screen space.
Asynchronous Data Fetching:
Implement a function to fetch suggestions from a remote server or API based on the user's input.
Utilize React's lifecycle methods or hooks (such as useEffect and useState) to manage the asynchronous data fetching process.
Handle loading states and display feedback to the user during the fetching process.
Debounce:
Implement a debounce mechanism to optimize the data fetching process.
Use a debounce function or a library like Lodash to delay the execution of the fetch function after the user stops typing.
List Rendering:
Render the fetched suggestions in the dropdown list below the input field.
Each suggestion should be clickable, allowing users to select it and populate the input field with the chosen suggestion.
Provide visual feedback to indicate the currently selected suggestion, such as highlighting or changing its background color.
